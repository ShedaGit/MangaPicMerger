# MangaPicMerger WPF Application

This is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application that allows users to merge two images and create a new image with a bar between the two merged images if needed.

## Refactoring

The code has already been refactored to improve its readability, maintainability and reusability.

Refactored version will be uploaded in the near future.

Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio 2022.

## How to Use

1. Click on the "Browse" button and select two images you want to merge. They can be in PNG or JPEG format.
2. If two images are selected, they will be displayed in the left and right image viewers.
3. If needed, click on the "Switch" button to switch the left and right images.
4. Select the type of bar that you want to appear between the two merged images:
    * No Bar
    * White Bar
    * Black Bar
5. If you selected a white or black bar, select the width of the bar using the slider or by typing a value into the textbox.
6. Click on the "Merge" button to create the merged image.
7. If prompted, choose a name and location for the merged image and select a file type (PNG or JPEG).

Note: Both images must have the same dimensions.
